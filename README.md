# Welcome to a tribute to AndroDunos

## Introduction

We are four students from CITM in Terrassa and in our Project 1 subject we are making a tribute to the retro game AndroDunos.

## Description

AndroDunos is a horizontal scroller shoot'em up for NeoGeo which was made in the average nineties, it was made by Visco Games and was distributed by SNK. The game is able to be played by one or two people at the same time.

The theme of the game is placed in the future where the human being is able to travel around the space, but meanwhile an alien being is trying to conquest the Earth and it is doing so. The player have to beat the enemys while piloting the spaceship and dodging the enemy attacks.
